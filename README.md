# HTML-Latitude-Weather
This program uses HTML to display the data obtained using the [Python-API-Weather](https://github.com/finnwurtz/Python-API-Weather) program.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, HTML, CSS

In this program, a Jupyter Notebook converts weather data from a CSV to an HTML file, allowing it to be viewed in a web browser using a [local server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server). The program is designed to organize information about global weather patterns into a straightforward and easy-to-navigate website. A webpage is included for each of several wealther variables. Most of the webpages include graphs that illustrate the relationship between latitude and different weather variables; several of them include supplemental commentary.

At the top of each webpage, an series of buttons allows visitors to navigate between the different pages on the site with ease and efficiency. While the 'plots' drop-down menu directs visitors to a list of pages that display a graph and commentary for each weather variable, the 'comparisons' page displays all of the graphs together and omits the commentary for visual clarity. Meanwhile, the 'project data' page gives visitors access to the data used to make the visualization, while the 'home' button brings visitors back to the home page. The Comic Sans typeface was chosen for this project due to its demonstrated advantage in facilitating [memory renention](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2010/10/28/font-focus-making-ideas-harder-read-may-make-them-easier-retain). The site frontend is written using a combination of HTML & CSS.
